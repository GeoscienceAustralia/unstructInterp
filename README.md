unstructInterp
==============

R routines for unstructured interpolation. A few methods are implemented which
work relatively efficiently on semi-large datasets (e.g. millions of points).

The code relies heavily on other packages (SearchTrees + geometry), and its
purpose is mainly to provide a convenient interface to some efficient interpolation
methods (and save us hacking to use them elsewhere!), rather than on developing
novel interpolation methods.

This code is sporadically developed based on the needs of the developers and
colleagues. The open source release is mainly to assist with our own management
of the code, as well as to allow others to use it. Bugfixes/suggestions are
nonetheless welcome. 

Note that many other R packages have routines for unstructured interpolation,
and only a few methods are supported here. 

FIXME: Insert information on installing directly from github

If you'd like to contribute any routines or fix bugs, consider forking the
code, inserting your changes and sending the maintainer a pull request.
Otherwise bug reports / suggestions can be sent to the maintainer.
